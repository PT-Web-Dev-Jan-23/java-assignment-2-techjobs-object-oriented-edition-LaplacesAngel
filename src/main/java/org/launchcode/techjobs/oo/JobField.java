    //Consider the following questions to help you decide what code to put in the JobField class:
    //
    //What fields do ALL FOUR of the classes have in common?
    //
    //Which constructors are the same in ALL FOUR classes?
    //
    //What getters and setters do ALL of the classes share?
    //
    //Which custom methods are identical in ALL of the classes?
    //
    //In JobField, declare each of the common fields.
    //
    //Code the constructors.
    //
    //Use Generate to create the appropriate getters and setters.
    //
    //Add in the custom methods.
    //
    //Finally, to prevent the creation of a JobField object, make this class abstract.
